> An open-source, low-cost (inr 2000 BOM) discreet safety wristband engineered to automatically buffer, cryptographically sign, and stream evidence during emergencies—even if the device is forcibly seized or destroyed.

---

## Overview

**Heimdall's Watch** addresses the core vulnerability of traditional emergency alerting tools: preventing an attacker from destroying evidence by capturing and transmitting proof *before* and *during* an incident. 

Built on an **ESP32-S3** microcontroller and **SIM7080G LTE-M modem**, the wristband maintains a continuous 30-second rolling video and audio buffer in volatile PSRAM. Upon manual activation or automatic detection (sudden impact, forced removal), the device cryptographically signs 2-second evidence chunks (SHA-256 + ECDSA) attached with UTC timestamps, GNSS coordinates, and ambient Wi-Fi/BLE signatures, streaming them progressively to cloud endpoints and trusted emergency contacts.

---

## Key Features

- **📷 Pre-Event Memory Buffer:** Maintains a continuous 15–30 second rolling video/audio loop in volatile PSRAM, capturing context immediately *before* an emergency trigger.
- **🆘 Discreet SOS & Anomaly Triggering:** Activates via a flush, silent tactile switch or automated 6-axis IMU detection (impacts, falls, abnormal motion).
- ** Hardware Cryptographic Signing:** Signs every 2-second chunk with SHA-256 hashing and ECDSA signatures bound to the device’s hardware key to establish legal chain-of-custody.
- **📦 Progressive Chunked Upload:** Slices media into 2-second encrypted fragments, transmitting data progressively so partial evidence survives network dropouts or device destruction.
- ** GNSS & Contextual RF Logging:** Attaches precise GPS coordinates along with passive Wi-Fi BSSID and Bluetooth MAC signatures as secondary location verification.
- **Offline Local Backup:** Encrypts and stores unsent evidence chunks on onboard SPI NAND flash during network blackouts, uploading automatically upon reconnection.
- **🔓 Tamper & Removal Detection:** Triggers instant alert transmissions if the strap is cut or optical skin proximity is lost.
- **☀️ Solar-Assisted Charging:** Embedded flexible OPV solar strip along the wristband for trickle-charging power supplementation.

## Cryptographic Chain of Custody

To guarantee evidence is admissible in legal proceedings, the system enforces strict hardware-level authenticity verification:

1. **Device-Bound Key Creation:** Unique private keys are generated inside the MCU's protected hardware enclave during provisioning.
2. **Chunk Hashing:** Every 2-second video/audio slice, along with UTC timestamp and GPS coordinates, is hashed using SHA-256.
3. **ECDSA Signature:** The digest is signed using the device's private key before upload.
4. **Append-Only Cloud Ledger:** Cloud endpoints verify the signature against the public registry before logging the file manifest into an auditable ledger.
